    <h2>What are Flashlight Fish?</h2>
    <p>Flashlight fish are a group of bioluminescent fish that have light-emitting organs under their eyes. These fascinating creatures use their glow for communication, navigation, and attracting prey in the dark depths of the ocean.</p>
    
    <h2>Bioluminescence in Action</h2>
    <p>The light produced by flashlight fish is due to symbiotic bacteria that live in their light organs. By controlling the exposure of these bacteria, they can flash their lights on and off, which helps them avoid predators and coordinate with their school.</p>
